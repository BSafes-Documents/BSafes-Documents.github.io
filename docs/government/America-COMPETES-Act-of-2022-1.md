## DIVISION A: Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America
**Semiconductors are essential to our national security and our economic competitiveness – but over the past 30 years the United States’ share of global semiconductor manufacturing has significantly decreased, putting our national and economic security at risk. The America COMPETES Act of 2022 appropriates $52 billion for the CHIPS for America Act – critical investments to support continued American technological leadership in semiconductor fabrication, address supply chain disruptions and ensure more semiconductors are produced here at home.**

- In December 2020, Congress enacted the landmark CHIPS Act to help rebuild U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity and to advance U.S. semiconductor research and innovation, through new partnerships among industry, Federal science agencies, National Labs and academia. 

- The America COMPETES Act of 2022 provides urgently needed funding to the R&D programs authorized in the CHIPS Act, including funding to stand up the National Semiconductor Technology Center, expand semiconductor manufacturing R&D under the Manufacturing USA Program, and establish an advanced packaging R&D program. 

- This bill provides substantial financial assistance to incentivize investment in facilities and equipment for semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, advanced packaging, and research and development.

  - The financial assistance may be used for the construction, expansion or modernization of semiconductor facilities, support workforce development, and pay the reasonable costs of operating a semiconductor facility.

- It invests $2 billion to support critical components in the production of many automobiles, consumer electronics and defense systems.
