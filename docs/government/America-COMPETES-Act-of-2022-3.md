## DIVISON C: Committee on Energy and Commerce
**The America COMPETES Act of 2022 will strengthen our economy and national security by preventing shortages of critical goods and ensuring that more of these goods are made right here in the United States.**

### Strengthening Our Supply Chains 
- Improves our nation’s supply chains to strengthen our economy and national security by preventing shortages of critical goods and ensuring that more of these goods are made right here in the United States. 

- Establishes a new Office within the Department of Commerce to lead a governmentwide effort to strengthen supply chains critical to the nation’s economic vitality and national security, specifically charged with:

  - **monitoring supply chains** to identify vulnerabilities or gaps that may disrupt the availability of critical goods; 

  - **supporting the availability of critical goods** to prevent shortages that could imperil our national security and economy; 

  - **preparing for and responding to supply chain shocks;** 

  - **reducing reliance on critical goods from countries of concern and encouraging the relocation of manufacturing facilities out of these countries;**

  - **supporting the creation of jobs with competitive wages**, including by preserving existing collective bargaining agreements and supporting union organizing efforts; and 

  - **promoting the health of the economy and competitiveness of American manufacturing** by creating the market conditions necessary to improve supply chain resilience and allow American manufacturers to compete on a level-playing field.
  
- Authorizes $45 billion for grants, loans, and loan guarantees to support supply chain resilience and manufacturing of critical goods, industrial equipment, and manufacturing technology:

  - **support the manufacturing or acquisition of critical goods or industrial equipment that are essential for the national security and economic vitality.** Critical goods, as designated by the Office, may include key components and products for public health and biological preparedness, information and communications technology, the energy and transportation sector’s industrial base, and agricultural commodities and food product supply chains;
  
  - **develop or acquire manufacturing technology that improves the ability of manufacturers to produce critical goods**. Such technologies may include information technology needed to optimize manufacturing efficiency, flexibility, speed, quality, and sustainability; 

  - **construct or enhance critical infrastructure or a manufacturing facility,** which may include factories, telecommunications infrastructure, and water systems necessary to support the production of critical goods; 

  - **relocate a manufacturing facility out of countries of concern**, including countries that pose a significant economic or national security threat to the United States; 

  - **manufacture or acquire a substitute for critical goods, industrial equipment, or manufacturing technology** to provide a viable alternative to scarce or vulnerable critical goods; 

  - **establish or preserve surge capacity or stockpiles** to provide the redundancies and reserves necessary to maintain the availability of critical goods during supply chain shocks; and 

  - **establish diverse and secure sources and locations for the production of critical goods** to ensure that regional conflicts or disasters – such as tsunamis, hurricanes, or cold waves – do not incapacitate the nation’s ability to produce and acquire critical goods.

- Creates a program within the new Office at the Department of Commerce to map and monitor supply chains, identify supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities, and identify opportunities to address supply chain risk.

  - The resources required for comprehensive supply chain mapping and monitoring can be expensive, presenting barriers for individual firms seeking to identify and address vulnerabilities alone. The government can foster greater supply chain transparency and information sharing to assist individual firms detect, respond to, and recover from supply chain shocks for critical goods.

- America COMPETES authorizes $500 million to the Office for supply chain mapping and monitoring in order to: designate critical industries, supply chains, and critical goods that have a significant effect on the national security or economic security of the United States; produce quadrennial reviews on the state of supply chain resilience and domestic manufacturing; and establish a coordination group to identify and assess the resilience of supply chains and inform supply chain management.

- Equips the private sector with best practices and guidelines needed to proactively identify and mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities. America COMPETES authorizes $500 million for the Office at the Department of Commerce to coordinate with stakeholders and incorporate industry expertise to identify approaches that may be voluntarily adopted by domestic manufacturers and entities purchasing or using a critical good to manage supply chain risks and value supply chain resilience.

### Investing in Solar Manufacturing Supply Chain & Enhancing Grid Resilience
- Reduces our reliance on China by investing in building our nation’s solar manufacturing supply chain and keeps our electric grid secure and resilient in the face of evolving cybersecurity and physical security threats. 

- Authorizes $3 billion to fund the establishment of a domestic solar manufacturing supply chain – incentivizing the new construction of solar manufacturing capacity and providing grants and direct loans to retool, retrofit or expand existing solar manufacturing facilities. 

- Authorizes $375 million to reduce the vulnerability of the electric grid by establishing a Strategic Transformer Reserve and for the development, testing and monitoring of critical electric grid equipment.

### Improving Our Medical Product Supply Chain & Strengthening Our Strategic National Stockpile 
- Increases the domestic drug manufacturing base by expanding the use of advanced and continuous manufacturing practices. 

- Gives FDA authority to require a manufacturer to cease distributing or recall drugs when a drug is known to cause serious adverse health consequences or death. 

- Provides transparency in the drug supply chain – requiring manufacturers to provide additional information to FDA about manufacturing sites and the quantity of drugs they produce. 

- Cracks down on drug manufacturers that falsify data and destroy important documents ahead of planned inspections. 

- Establishes a $1.5 billion supply chain manufacturing pilot in order to enhance medical supply chain elasticity and maintain domestic reserves of critical medical supplies. 

- Strengthens the overall management of the Strategic National Stockpile including by requiring contents remain in good working order, improving the process for requesting supplies and exploring stable funding sources.

- Establishes a $10.5 billion pilot program that awards grants to states to expand or maintain a strategic stockpile of commercially available drugs, medical equipment, PPE and other products deemed by the state to be essential in the event of a public health emergency.

### Innovating Our Wireless Supply Chain & Network Security
- Ensures that the next-generation mobile wireless networks and technologies are safe and secure from foreign adversaries by funding the deployment of cutting-edge technology, enhancing the competitiveness of trusted suppliers of information and communication technology and supporting American thought leadership in network and supply chain security. 

- Appropriates $1.5 billion for the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund to deploy Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) network equipment to spur movement toward open architecture, software-based wireless technologies and funding innovative leap-ahead technologies in the U.S. mobile broadband market. 

- Examines the cybersecurity of mobile wireless networks 

- Determines the elements of the information and communication technology supply chain critical to the economic competitiveness of the U.S. 

- Identifies and develops solutions for potential emerging issues with 6G networks 

- Codifies the responsibility of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration with respect to cybersecurity of communication networks 

- Provides American consumers with the tools necessary to minimize cybersecurity risks 

- Establishes a permanent advisory council at the FCC to increase the security, reliability and interoperability of communications networks

- Promotes U.S. wireless leadership abroad
