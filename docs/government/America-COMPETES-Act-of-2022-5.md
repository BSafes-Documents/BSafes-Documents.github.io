## DIVISION E – Committee on Oversight and Reform
**The America COMPETES Act of 2022 ensures U.S. innovation and global leadership in emerging technology by developing and fostering programs within the federal government to attract top cyber talent. At the same time, it protects the privacy and civil liberties of Americans as we explore new technological frontiers.**

### Artificial Intelligence in Counterterrorism Oversight Enhancement Act
- This provision would strengthen oversight and governance related to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies by giving the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board access to the AI-enabled programs in use at federal agencies. 

- With the rise of emerging technologies, the provision would ensure that the rights of Americans are protected.

### Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program
- This provision in the America COMPETES Act of 2022 would improve the federal government’s ability to respond to cyberattacks by creating a cadre of cybersecurity professionals at federal agencies and creating valuable career development opportunities.
