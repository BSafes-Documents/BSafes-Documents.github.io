## DIVISION F – Committee on Homeland Security
### Homeland Procurement Reform
- Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that procurement of uniforms and other clothing and protective equipment for a DHS operational component, such as TSA or CBP, meet the following criteria:

  - To the maximum extent possible, at least one-third of the funds obligated for the procurement of uniforms and related gear be used to purchase goods manufactured or supplied by entities that qualify as a U.S. small business. 
  
  - Each contractor is registered in the System for Award Management and is in compliance with quality control standards deemed appropriate by the Secretary. 
  
  - Each supplier of covered items bearing DHS insignia that are not produced, applied, or assembled within the U.S. secures such items in a manner established by the Secretary.

### DHS Software Supply Chain Risk Management 
- Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to bolster cybersecurity within DHS by issuing Departmentwide guidance for contractors providing new information and communications technology or services contracts for DHS. Such guidance shall require contractors to certify to the Department that each item listed on a submitted bill of materials (software and hardware) is free from all known cyber vulnerabilities and defects affecting the security of the end product or service supplied to DHS. It also requires the contract to notify DHS of any identified vulnerability or defect and provide information on how such vulnerability or defect will be mitigated, repaired or resolved.

### Department of Homeland Security Mentor-Protégé Program
- Authorizes a mentor protégé program within the Department of Homeland Security to enhance opportunities for U.S. small businesses to compete in the Federal marketplace. Under the program, a large contractor or “mentor firm” enters into an agreement with a protégé firm for the purpose of assisting a small business or “protégé firm” to compete for prime contracts and subcontracts of the Department.

### Unmanned Aerial Security
- Prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Security from operating, procuring, or providing financial assistance for an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) that is (1) manufactured in a covered foreign country, (2) uses devices manufactured in a foreign country, (3) uses a ground control systems or operating software developed in a foreign covered country, or (4) uses network connectivity or data storage located in a covered foreign country. It also prohibits the use of any of those technologies if they are manufactured, developed, or administered by a corporation domiciled in a covered foreign country. On a limited basis, the DHS Secretary may waive such prohibition with certification to Congress.
