### II. The Need for the House to Impeach President Trump
For the reasons stated herein, the President’s conduct easily meets the standard for committing an impeachable offense. Further, his prior and ongoing conduct confirm his imminent threat to our security and democracy if he remains in or holds any future office and, therefore, the House must impeach President Trump.

#### **A. Standards for Impeachment**

President Trump’s unprecedented actions in inciting an insurrectionist assault on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, necessitate that the House act swiftly to address this impeachable conduct.

His conduct demonstrates and cautions that, if left in office—or if allowed to hold office in the future—he will be a clear and present danger to the very foundation of our constitutional order and the safety and security of our nation. Under these unprecedented and extraordinary circumstances, the House neither needs nor can it afford to resort to a lengthy impeachment proceeding. To the contrary, it is entirely within the power of the House under the Constitution to act quickly.

On December 15, 2019, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives issued a report entitled “Impeachment of Donald J. Trump President of the United States.”<sup>116</sup> As that report explains, the House’s authority to structure an impeachment is rooted in two provisions of Article I of the Constitution. First, Article I vests the House with the “sole Power of Impeachment.”<sup>117</sup> It imposes no other requirements as to how the House must carry out that responsibility. Second, Article I further states that the House is empowered to “determine the Rules of its Proceedings.”<sup>118</sup> Taken together, these provisions give the House sole discretion to determine the manner in which it will investigate, deliberate, and vote upon grounds for impeachment.

House precedent confirms that the House may proceed directly to consideration of articles of impeachment on the House floor. As Jefferson’s Manual notes, “[i]n the House various events have been credited with setting an impeachment in motion,” including charges made on the floor, resolutions introduced by Members, or “facts developed and reported by an investigating committee of the House.”<sup>119</sup> Indeed, any Member can call up a resolution containing articles of impeachment on the floor as a question of the privileges of the House. The House can dispose of the resolution in several ways including by voting on the resolution directly.

In the past, the House has conducted an inquiry to investigate allegations of impeachable misconduct against the President of the United States before voting directly on whether to adopt articles of impeachment. The unprecedented role President Trump played in inciting an insurrectionist assault on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, however, has created extraordinary circumstances that both demand the House act swiftly and obviate the need for the House to conduct a lengthy inquiry into his conduct. The urgency of the situation—as well as the fact that the President’s actions occurred in public, and many Members directly witnessed and were victim to the consequences of those actions—obviates the need for additional inquiry.<sup>120</sup>

#### **B. Application of Impeachment Standards to President Trump’s Conduct**

As the Article of Impeachment sets forth, President Trump’s conduct easily satisfies the standards for a high Crime and Misdemeanor.

##### **1. The Article of Impeachment Charges an Impeachable Offense**

The Committee on the Judiciary’s December 15, 2019 report is incorporated herein by reference<sup>121</sup>

As discussed in the Committee’s prior report, under that standard, there can be no doubt that President Trump has committed “high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” On January 6, 2021, he incited a mob to violently besiege the Capitol while the House, Senate, and Vice President met in Joint Session to count the electoral votes. The President’s conduct undermined our national security, threatened the integrity of our democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of government. Further, President Trump’s acts of incitement on January 6, 2021 followed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the election results. As noted, those efforts include, but are not limited to, a call in which he urged the Georgia’s Secretary of State, to “find” enough votes to overturn the Georgia Presidential election results and threatened state officials if they failed to accede to his demands.

As constitutional commentators from across the ideological spectrum have recognized, this conduct is unquestionably impeachable.<sup>122</sup> A President who incites violence against the Congress and three of the highest-level federal officials—and does so while Congress counts the electoral votes in an election that he lost—imperils the constitutional system. This offense is precisely the sort of conduct warranting impeachment and removal from office.

To the Framers, that conclusion would be self-evident. Their worldview was shaped by a study of classical history, as well as a lived experience of resistance and revolution. From that background emerged an exquisite sensitivity to the paired dangers of the mob and the demagogue, which they associated with “the threat of civil disorder and the early assumption of power by a dictator.”<sup>123</sup> Shay’s Rebellion in 1786 gave that concern heightened salience at the Constitutional Convention, where the Framers—fearful of unruly mobs—sought to restrain excesses of popular passion.<sup>124</sup> James Madison, in particular, worked hard “to avoid the fate of those ‘ancient and modern confederacies,’ which he believed had succumbed to rule by demagogues and mobs.”<sup>125</sup> Several of the Federalist Papers similarly warned against demagogues who would aggrandize themselves, and threaten the young Republic, by stirring popular fury and delusion.<sup>126</sup> The generation that came of age in the eighteenth century was familiar with leaders who incited angry mobs and threatened constitutional stability. They would have immediately recognized President Trump’s conduct on January 6, 2021. And they would not hesitate to declare that a President who incites a mob to charge, breach, and desecrate the Capitol had committed an impeachable offense.

That is particularly true when the President engaged in such conduct while Congress met to count. As the House Judiciary Committee explained in its previous impeachment report, the Framers viewed an attack on democracy—and the integrity of the Electoral College process, in particular—as presenting a paradigm case for impeachment:

> The Framers also anticipated impeachment if a President placed his own interest in retaining power above the national interest in free and fair elections. Several delegates were explicit on this point when the topic arose at the Constitutional Convention. By then, the Framers had created the Electoral College. They were “satisfied with it as a tool for picking presidents but feared that individual electors might be intimidated or corrupted.” Impeachment was their answer. William Davie led off the discussion, warning that a President who abused his office might seek to escape accountability by interfering with elections, sparing “no efforts or means whatever to get himself re-elected.” Rendering the President ‘‘impeachable whilst in office’’ was thus “an essential security for the good behaviour of the Executive.” The Constitution thereby ensured that corrupt Presidents could not avoid justice by subverting elections and remaining in office.

> George Mason built on Davie’s position, directing attention to the Electoral College: “One objection agst. Electors was the danger of their being corrupted by the Candidates; & this furnished a peculiar reason in favor of impeachments whilst in office. Shall the man who has practised corruption & by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment, by repeating his guilt?” Mason’s concern was straightforward. He feared that Presidents would win election by improperly influencing members of the Electoral College (e.g., by offering them bribes). If evidence of such wrongdoing came to light, it would be unthinkable to leave the President in office—especially given that he might seek to avoid punishment by corrupting the next election. In that circumstance, Mason concluded, the President should face impeachment and removal under the Constitution. Notably, Mason was not alone in this view. Speaking just a short while later, Gouverneur Morris emphatically agreed that “_the Executive ought therefore to be impeachable for . . . Corrupting his electors_” ...

> When the President concludes that elections threaten his continued grasp on power, and therefore seeks to corrupt or interfere with them, he denies the very premise of our constitutional system. The American people choose their leaders; a President who wields power to destroy opponents or manipulate elections is a President who rejects democracy itself.<sup>127</sup>

Given the Framers’ paramount concern for the integrity of the democratic process, and their fear that a President might seek to corrupt the Electoral College, there can be no doubt that President Trump committed “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” in unleashing a violent mob on the Capitol while Congress met to count Electoral College votes. Indeed, this timing was no coincidence: President Trump’s acts of incitement on January 6, 2021 were inextricably linked to a broader course of conduct aimed at delegitimizing the election results, obstructing and subverting the electoral process, and sowing discord and confusion in the Nation’s democratic system.

Yet another aspect of President Trump’s conduct confirms that it ranks as impeachable: the existential threat it posed to the separation of powers. The Framers knew that “[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.”<sup>128</sup> To protect liberty, they wrote a Constitution that creates a system of checks and balances within the federal government. Some of those rules are expressly enumerated in our founding charter; others are implied from its structure or from traditions of inter-branch relations. As our history makes clear, a President may be subject to impeachment for conduct that usurps and destroys core constitutional prerogatives of Congress or the Judiciary.<sup>129</sup> From that premise, it is obvious that the President commits an impeachable offense if he engages in conduct, such as inciting a violent attack upon the Capitol, that places legislators in mortal peril and forces them to hurriedly evacuate the legislative chamber. The separation of powers cannot function if the President incites violence against the Congress—and if the Congress must proceed in fear of a President who has demonstrated his willingness to endanger its very security.

Of course, it was not only Congress whose security President Trump put at risk on January 6, 2021. His own Vice President was presiding over the Joint Session and was endangered. President Trump’s acts of incitement also harmed the national security of the United States—both by virtue of the intelligence risks resulting from a physical intrusion of the Capitol and by virtue of the signal it sent to the Nation’s adversaries, foreign and domestic. This, too, supports the conclusion that President Trump’s misconduct rises to the level of an impeachable offense: “Impeachment for betrayal of the Nation’s interest—and especially for betrayal of national security—was hardly exotic to the Framers.”<sup>130</sup>

For all these reasons, the conduct charged in the Article of Impeachment constitutes a “high Crime and Misdemeanor” under the Constitution. “There comes a point at which a president can properly be impeached for his statements”<sup>131</sup>—and that point is indisputably reached when the President incites an assault on the legislature amid the constitutional process for the transfer of power. Both as an abusive exercise of presidential power, and as an instance of gross misconduct implicating our system of government committed while occupying the office of presidency, it falls within any reasoned interpretation of“high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”

##### **2. President Trump Committed the Charged Impeachable Offense**

On January 6, 2021, President Trump committed the impeachable offense of incitement of insurrection by willfully making statements that, in context, encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol. As explained above, he set the stage for the Capitol attack in the months leading up to January 6th, and on that date, he exhorted the mob into a frenzy, aimed it like a loaded gun down Pennsylvania Avenue, and pulled the trigger. His statements and actions surrounding this act of incitement confirm the conduct charged in the article of impeachment.

President Trump expressly and impliedly encouraged his supporters to besiege the Capitol and engage in violent, unlawful conduct. The mob did not come together—united in purpose, mission, and plan—by accident. It did not engage in violence, or breach the Capitol’s defenses, without encouragement and provocation from President Trump. To the contrary, since Election Day, President Trump has done everything in his power, including taking steps beyond his lawful authority, to convince his supporters that they are victims of the greatest electoral fraud in history. He has blamed this “fraud” on state officials, state courts, federal courts, the media, Congress, and election administrators. He has convinced many of his supporters, falsely, that they actually voted him back into power and that their votes—indeed, their fundamental rights—have fallen victim to an array of nefarious forces working against them. To that end, he has repeatedly called on his supporters to “step up & FIGHT BACK” to resist “the steal.”<sup>132</sup> He has personally threatened election officials, including Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger, if they do not “find” votes or take steps needed to overturn the popular will.<sup>133</sup> Following his lead, President Trump’s supporters have engaged in harassment and violent threats—including calls for a senior official who oversaw the United States election infrastructure to be “taken out at dawn and shot.”<sup>134</sup> The president’s rhetoric led Gabriel Sterling, an election official in Georgia, to issue a prophetic warning in the aftermath of the election: “Mr. President . . . Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone’s going to get hurt, someone’s going to get shot, someone’s going to get killed.”<sup>135</sup>

Having promoted the false belief that his supporters are victims of a historic fraud—one that threatened not only America, but also their very safety and that of their families—President Trump called them to a “Save America Rally.” He planned that rally on the very same day that his supporters had been led to believe the Congress was assembled with Vice President Pence to carry out the final and most irreversible step of the conspiracy against them. In advance of the Rally, he told his supporters to prepare for a “Historic” and “wild” day: “Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”<sup>136</sup> In response to a supporter claiming that “[t]he calvary [sic] is coming, Mr. President!”, President Trump responded, “A great honor!”<sup>137</sup> And he made the target of his ire well-known: the Capitol and the officials meeting therein—including the Vice President, who he criticized publicly and privately as disloyal for failing to take unconstitutional measures to alter the election outcome.<sup>138</sup>

At the January 6th rally, the President’s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani took the stage and called for “trial by combat.”<sup>139</sup> The President’s son, Donald Trump Jr., warned Republican congressmembers who did not support his father that “we’re coming for you.”<sup>140</sup> When President Trump took the stage, his own address was riddled with statements calculated to toss a match into the powder keg he had created. He enflamed the crowd by repeating his election grievances. He directed their ire towards Congress, including by calling out specific legislators: “And we got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren’t any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world, we got to get rid of them.” He told them to “fight like Hell and if you don’t fight like Hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” And finally, after riling up the crowd and giving them their marching orders, he aimed them at the Capitol: “After this, we’re going to walk down and I’ll be there with you. We’re going to walk down. We’re going to walk down any one you want, but I think right here.”<sup>141</sup>

As multiple lawmakers have observed, there can be no doubt that President Trump expressly and impliedly inflamed his supporters, pointed them straight at the Capitol, and encouraged them to take extraordinary, violent measures in response to a supposed evil conspiracy against them unfolding at the Capitol. As Senator Susan Collins explained: “The president does bear responsibility for working up the crowd and inciting this mob.”<sup>142</sup> Similarly, Senator Sasse has observed: “I think it’s obvious that the president’s conduct wasn’t merely reckless and destructive. It was a flagrant dereliction of his duty to uphold and defend the Constitution.”<sup>143</sup> And the President’s own former Attorney General echoed,“orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable.”<sup>144</sup>

In the days leading up to the Save America Rally, President Trump touted the “thousands of people pouring into D.C.” who “won’t stand for a landslide election victory being stolen.”<sup>145</sup> Supporters of President Trump met across Washington, D.C., joined by his close allies, including General Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, and speakers rallied the crowd with calls of “We’re not backing down anymore” and “It is time for war.”<sup>146</sup> It was entirely foreseeable in this circumstance that the mob—fired up, some armed and armored, some with public plans for doing so—would engage in violence at the Capitol as an imminent result of President Trump’s encouragement and incitement at the rally.

It was also widely reported that militia groups and members had posted pictures with weaponry that they planned to bring to the rally, and had posted numerous times about how to storm and occupy the Capitol.<sup>147</sup> Several people had been arrested, including on weapons-related charges, for assaulting a police officer and simple assault.<sup>148</sup> The leader of the Proud Boys, a group the President previously told to “stand back and stand by”<sup>149</sup> on national television, was arrested for destruction of church property.<sup>150</sup> Recognizing the potential for violence, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser asked residents to stay away from the downtown area where the Rally would take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, and mobilized every city police officer.<sup>151</sup>

These events also make clear that President Trump acted willfully. He actively encouraged the mob to besiege the Capitol in defense of his supposed electoral victory. In context, it was readily foreseeable that this would result in violence and lawless action. And it did, in fact, have that result. Given all that, there can be no serious doubt that President Trump intended these reasonably foreseeable results encouraged by his own conduct. He may not have anticipated every detail, but any reasonable person would understand that inflaming a mob containing armed, angry supporters, and then directing them towards the Capitol with the goal of “fighting like Hell” and thwarting a supposed massive electoral conspiracy would result in violence and destruction. Indeed, the contrary inference—that the President accidentally incited the mob to violence, and that he was accordingly shocked and dismayed by the mayhem it caused—is squarely inconsistent with the facts.

That is evident, first and foremost, in how President Trump acted after the Capitol came under attack. While his supporters undertook a hostile occupation and ransacking of the Capitol— and after reports of gunshots and violence in the Capitol had become public on national television<sup>152</sup>—the President made no effort to quell the violence and destruction. Just minutes after the Sergeant at Arms announced that the Capitol had been reclaimed from the mob, and much of the destruction had occurred, he tweeted: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.”<sup>153</sup> There was no denunciation of what had occurred, no urgent plea that his supporters lay down their arms, no national statement.<sup>154</sup> Instead, as Senator Sasse relayed from a conversation with senior White House officials, President Trump was “walking around the White House confused about why other people on his team weren’t as excited as he was as you had rioters pushing against Capitol Police trying to get into the building.”<sup>155</sup> He was “delighted.”<sup>156</sup> And while the Senators were in lockdown, President Trump called one of them, not to check on his wellbeing or assess security risks, rather to encourage the Senator to object to the Electoral College vote.<sup>157</sup>

The President’s statements during the assault similarly confirm his intent. He tweeted multiple times, first to criticize the Vice President for not having “the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.”<sup>158</sup> Next, still not calling for the mob to leave the Capitol, or for a massive deployment of force to retake the building, he issued two vague calls for his supporters to “stay peaceful” and “remain peaceful” despite overwhelming, public evidence that the mob was actively engaging in violence and destruction inside the Capitol.<sup>159</sup> And finally, well into the siege, he released a video in which he again reiterated his claims of election fraud and said that the election that was “stolen from us.” While this video included a weak call for “peace” and “law and order,” he also told his supporters—a band of whom were wreaking destruction in the Capitol—that “we love you, you’re very special.”<sup>160</sup> To date, the President has taken no responsibility and shown no personal regret for his role in what occurred. This is clear evidence that the President acted willfully in inciting the mob.

Both members of the mob and Members of Congress recognized that it was the President who had sent the mob to Congress, they reasonably understood what he was saying,<sup>161</sup> and that it was he alone who could pull them back. A man inside the Capitol was captured on video saying: “Our president wants us here . . . We wait and take orders from our president.”<sup>162</sup> Members of Congress, in turn, called on the President to call off his mob. As Representative Mike Gallagher tweeted during the Capitol occupation, “Mr. President. You have got to stop this. You are the only person who can call this off.”<sup>163</sup> Similarly, Mick Mulvaney, the President’s former Chief of Staff, tweeted, “The President’s tweet is not enough. He can stop this now and needs to do exactly that. Tell these folks to go home.”<sup>164</sup> But these pleas fell on deaf ears until well into the sacking of the Capitol. That further proves willful conduct.

Many others, including current and former members of President Trump’s administration, have recognized that the President intended to incite violence aimed at the Capitol. As now former- Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos told the President, “[t]here is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation.”<sup>165</sup> Lawmakers similarly recognized the President’s intent. As Senator Lisa Murkowski remarked, the President “told his supporters to fight. How are they supposed to take that? It’s an order from the president. And so that’s what they did. They came up and they fought and people were harmed, and injured and died.”<sup>166</sup> Senator Mitt Romney echoed these sentiments: “What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States.”<sup>167</sup> So did Senator Sasse: “This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president’s addiction to constantly stoking division.”<sup>168</sup> As Representative Liz Cheney noted after President Trump told his mob to “get rid of” her: “There’s no question the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. He lit the flame.”<sup>169</sup> There is thus overwhelming evidence that President Trump committed the “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” charged in the article of impeachment against him.

##### **3. President Trump’s Conduct Harmed Core National Interests**

President Trump’s impeachable conduct, exacerbated by his further acts and omissions after he incited the crowd to attack the Capitol, grievously injured the national interests of the United States. It threatened democratic self-governance by interfering with the peaceful transition of power, imperiled a coequal branch of government, endangered our national security, and betrayed his oath of office and the trust of the American people.

###### **a. Attack on Democratic Processes and the Peaceful Transition of Power**

The insurrection incited by President Trump had a clear goal: attack, menace, obstruct, and ultimately prevent Congress in any way from carrying out its solemn constitutional duty to count the Electoral College vote. In fact, the rioters managed to delay the democratic processes for at least six hours. And, although the Joint Session reconvened and fulfilled its duty that same day, the lasting injury to our nation cannot be overstated.

At the heart of our Constitution is a commitment to popular sovereignty. At the core of that framework is the election of representatives to the United States Congress and the establishment of the Electoral College as the method of selection for the President and Vice President of the United States. The democratically elected Members of the Congress are charged with legislating and carrying important constitutional duties on behalf of the American people.

Under the Twelfth Amendment and the Electoral Count Act of 1887, the Congress is responsible for counting and the Electoral College votes, while the Vice President, as president of the Senate, plays a ministerial role in the proceedings.<sup>170</sup> In this way, the will of the American people is formally implemented, and the legitimacy to exercise the authorities of the national government bestowed on our elected federal officials. Another purpose of this process is to facilitate the orderly and peaceful transfer of power between elected officials.

The course of conduct President Trump pursued leading up to January 6, 2021 directly sought to undermine that very foundation of our Constitution. His conduct, contrary to our democracy, encouraged and foreseeably resulted in violent chaos aimed to subvert and obstruct the peaceful transfer of power. President Trump for weeks promoted not only false allegations of voter fraud, but the fringe constitutional theory that the Vice President is the sole arbiter of the Electoral College vote. The President then used the rage he had incited to encourage a physical assault on our the Capitol, in the very moments that the peaceful transfer of power administered by our elected officials was underway. In sum, the President’s conduct in inciting an insurrection against our government, designed to subvert and obstruct the results of our free and fair elections, caused serious harm to our nation’s fundamental interest in orderly democratic self-governance.

The Framers included the power of impeachment to thwart exactly such attempts at eroding our nation’s commitment to popular sovereignty. As explained in the Judiciary Committee’s previous impeachment report from the 116th Congress: “***[T]he true nature of this threat is its rejection of government by ‘We the People***,’ who would ‘ordain and establish’ the Constitution ... When the President concludes that elections threaten his continued grasp on power, and therefore seeks to corrupt or interfere with them, he denies the very premise of our constitutional system. The American people choose their leaders; ***a President who wields power to destroy opponents or manipulate elections is a President who rejects democracy itself***.” <sup>171</sup>

###### **b. Imperiling a Coordinate Branch**

By engaging in this course of conduct President Trump willfully incited violence against the United States Congress, a coequal branch of the United States government, and the Vice President of the United States. Indeed, the violence that ensued jeopardized the safety of nearly the entire Legislative Branch, their staff, the many non-partisan workers employed by Congress, and the law enforcement officers serving to protect the Capitol. The insurrection incited by the President also threatened the safety of the three most senior officials in the presidential line of succession: Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and President pro tempore of the Senate Senator Chuck Grassley.

As described in detail in this report, many Members of Congress and their staff were forced to hide under tables or in offices while they awaited evacuation by law enforcement, while others were trapped on the House and Senate floor. Many feared for their lives, as armed attackers banged on the doors, and Capitol Police drew weapons.<sup>172</sup> Indeed, as set forth, at least five deaths occurred as a result of the violent mob’s ambush on our government.

In short, the insurrectionists incited by President Trump threatened the lives of everyone who works at the U.S. Capitol, including officials in the presidential line of succession, as well as the continued existence of a functioning Legislative Branch. As Representative Sean Maloney, who was present in the Capitol when the mob violence occurred, cautioned: “[f]or those pretending it’s something less than a violent insurrection, please watch and wake up. This is what [President Trump] and his enablers incited. He must be removed and held accountable.”<sup>173</sup>

###### **c. Harm to Our Nation’s National Security**

President Trump’s conduct directly harmed the national security of the United States. In the most immediate sense, the President’s incitement of the mob assault on the Capitol may have exposed sensitive materials and locations to the public creating immediate national security risks. In the long term, the insurrection caused lasting damage to the nation’s international reputation as a bastion of democratic order, undermining American “soft power” and emboldening our adversaries abroad.

Although there is not yet a complete account of the immediate consequences of the insurrection to our national security, the insurrectionists had access to, and stole, sensitive materials and electronics. As Michael Sherwin, acting United States attorney for the District of Columbia explained, “electronic items, were stolen from senators’ offices. Documents, materials, were stolen, and we have to identify what was done, mitigate that, and it could have potential national security equities. If there was damage, we don’t know the extent of that yet.”<sup>174</sup> Further, insurrectionists posted photos of areas in the Capitol generally off limits to the public, and some even livestreamed the attack on the internet. Both the Senate and the House, in coordination with federal law enforcement officials, will have to conduct an arduous top-to-bottom review to determine what devices have been stolen, whether documents have been taken or copied, and even if listening devices have been left behind by rioters.<sup>175</sup>

In addition to this immediate damage, the insurrection incited by President Trump has likely done incalculable damage to the United States’ reputation abroad as an exemplar of democratic self-governance. This event was broadcast live, in real time. Accordingly, it threatens to undermine the U.S.’s moral authority and hamper our ability to persuade other countries to take actions beneficial to U.S. national interests in the future. It will take substantial public diplomacy work by future Presidents to overcome the international damage done to the prestige of the United States. As reported in the news, for America’s adversaries, “there was no greater proof of the fallibility of Western democracy than the sight of the U.S. Capitol shrouded in smoke and besieged by a mob whipped up by their unwillingly outgoing president.”<sup>176</sup>

Already the insurrection incited by President Trump has been a propaganda boon to many authoritarian regimes. The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei of Iran said in a live televised speech that “[y]ou are now seeing the situation in the U.S. . . . This is their democracy and human rights, this is their election scandal, these are their values. These values are being mocked by the whole world. Even their friends are laughing at them.”<sup>177</sup> The foreign ministry of the People’s Republic of China made public statements justifying that government’s violent crackdown on Hong Kong pro-democracy protestors through comparisons to the rioters that attacked the U.S. Capitol.<sup>178</sup> And the President of Zimbabwe tweeted a call for the U.S. to end economic sanctions against that country’s authoritarian regime stating that “President Trump extended painful economic sanctions placed on Zimbabwe, citing concerns about Zimbabwe’s democracy” but that the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol “showed that the U.S. has no moral right to punish another nation under the guise of upholding democracy.”<sup>179</sup>

###### **d. Betrayal of Oath of Office and of the American People’s Trust**

President Trump’s incitement of the attack on the Capitol served only his interests. The President lost the election and—when he could not convince the courts or other elected officials to override—he engaged in disinformation and demagoguery to incite a mob in a last-ditch effort to retain power.

In other words, President Trump compromised our national security, the foundation of our democratic system, and our nation’s elected leaders, all in pursuit of his own personal and political advantage and self-interest. Through this conduct President Trump abdicated his Constitutional oath to faithfully execute our laws and his duty to place our nation’s interest, above his own. As President Trump’s former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster characterized it: “It was, in every sense of the phrase, a dereliction of duty.”<sup>180</sup> Following the conduct that led to his impeachment in December 2019, President Trump, for all the country and all the world to see, has once again demonstrated that he is unfit for office and will use any official means at his disposal— regardless of the harm caused to our nation—to hold onto political power.

#### **C. The Irrelevance of the Criminal Code and the Brandenburg Test**

It may well be the case that President Trump’s conduct on January 6, 2021—and other actions that he took in seeking to overturn and subvert the certification of the election results— violated the federal criminal code. Ultimately, that is a judgment for prosecutors and courts to make. The only question here is whether President Trump’s conduct warrants impeachment. As the House Judiciary Committee has previously explained, “[o]ffenses against the Constitution are different in kind than offenses against the criminal code . . . Impeachment and criminality must therefore be assessed separately.”<sup>181</sup> Accordingly, though it may indeed have done so, President Trump’s conduct need not have violated any federal criminal statutes in order for them to constitute “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” under the Constitution.

But foremost among them is the sad reality that President Trump and other officials have repeatedly compromised our principles in pursuit of partisan advantage and personal gain. Those who engaged in disinformation and demagoguery in pursuit of self-interest abdicated their responsibility to the American people. It was, in every sense of the phrase, a dereliction of duty”).

Nor is the Supreme Court’s decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio relevant to the question of impeachment.<sup>182</sup> In Brandenburg, the Court clarified that the First Amendment allows the criminal punishment of incitement. It then limited such liability to cases where “advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”<sup>183</sup>

To apply Brandenburg here—and to insist that President Trump cannot be impeached unless the Brandenburg test is met—would be to commit two fatal category errors.<sup>184</sup>

The first error involves a misstatement of First Amendment law. The Free Speech Clause guarantees that private citizens can engage in certain forms of expression without government regulation or prohibition. But it applies very differently to speech by government officials and public employees. By virtue of his high office, President Trump is no ordinary citizen. He occupies a position of public trust and directs the operations of the Executive Branch. As a high-level public official, the President is subject to different rules than private citizens and can be held accountable for his expression (including all expression relating to his office) in ways that they cannot be. That is a basic and well-established precept of First Amendment law. In fact, as Professor Ilya Somin observed, “Donald Trump himself has fired numerous cabinet officials and other subordinates because they expressed views he didn't like.”<sup>185</sup>

The second and more fundamental error involves a misunderstanding of the Impeachment Clause. For many of the same reasons that impeachment does not necessarily turn on criminality, it is not governed by a standard that defines when a person can be held responsible civilly or criminally for their speech. Impeachment is about preserving the Nation from a threat to the constitutional order, not imposing punishment. Nowhere did the Framers suggest that a President must be allowed to remain in office if his abuses involved speech that would otherwise be shielded from criminal regulation by the First Amendment. This would be a strange and irrational limitation: Presidents would be free to openly advocate the overthrow of the United States government, or the adoption of fascism, and Congress would be powerless to remove them on that basis. Moreover, given that many prior impeachable offenses have involved at least some conduct that might rank as protected speech, applying a rigid First Amendment rule in this field would risk obfuscating Presidential conduct—whether involving speech or not—that menaces the American democratic system.<sup>186</sup>

Simply put, President Trump has no free speech defense. President Trump is not a private citizen, free to say whatever he wants without accepting the consequences or recognizing the effects it might have on our system of government. As the head of the Executive Branch, his words can shake the nation—and so he is held to a higher standard than private citizens. Moreover, when it comes to the impeachment power, the question is not whether the President was free to say what he said. It is whether he has engaged in conduct that threatens the constitutional order. President Nixon engaged in speech when he ordered the cover-up of his crimes. President Trump engaged in speech when he sought to extort President Zelensky of Ukraine. Federal judges have engaged in speech when they abused their position. Yet neither the House nor the Senate have ever suggested that just because an impeachable offense involved speech, it cannot support impeachment unless some First Amendment standard is met.

Accordingly, the judgment for Congress to make is not whether President Trump had a free speech right to say what he said on January 6, 2021. It is whether that conduct qualified as a high Crime and Misdemeanor under the applicable constitutional standard. For the reasons set forth above, there can be no doubt that it did: inciting a mob to assault the Capitol while Congress meets in Joint Session to count the electoral votes in the presidential election results is plainly an impeachable offense.
